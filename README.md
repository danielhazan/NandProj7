# NandProj7

this project is my implementaion for project 7  in Nand course taken on 2nd year,
as one stage at building a compiler translating from high level code (the java- like jack language)
into assembler and machine code. this project focuses on translating from vm language into  assembler. 
the implementaion is based on python- object oriented manner which devides this mission into two classes: 
Parser (parses the vm code give as a file path) and CodeWriter (actual translating from vm to assembler)
